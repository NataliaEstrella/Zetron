# Access Code 2.2 Final Project Proposal

**Project Name:**
"The Poseidon Project"

**Team Name:**
Death to Dr. Pepper

**Team Members:**  
*Kaira Villanueva
*Jamaal Sedayao
*Natalia Estrella


## The Problem 
We combat the crippling effects of bordom with games. Also, the lack of games playable with others on the subway or other places without wifi connection. Most humans love games. 

## The Solution 
  * Demo 1 features: Have two devices connect through bluetooth. Actions done on one screen will the other connected device's screen.  
  *  Bonus features: Gyroscope heavy features. This will help users further engage in the game. 

## Execution [SOON]
  *  A detailed timeline for building the product, broken out by weekly sprints. Think about the user stories you would frame your weeks around. *Your polished MVP (baseline features) should be ready to demo by Demo 1 on Thursday 11/17/2015.*  
  *  A breakdown of team member responsibilities. Team members should take ownership over a specific feature or aspect of the app.
